    <p class="aboutP">
    I am a composer and performer from Nova Scotia with a Bachelor of Music from Acadia University, where I studied composition with Derek Charke and Peter Togni. I have been passionately composing and studying music since I was 12, with the piano being my primary instrument as well as my first experience with composing. </p> 
    <p class="aboutP">
     I am a lifelong learner and am always trying to incorporate ideas from different areas of knowledge into the music I write. This is my favourite thing about music, how it can function as a blank slate on which to project ideas from vastly different fields of knowledge, from those as subjective and personal as experience and emotion, to those as objective and abstract as science and mathematics. As long as there are new ideas there will always be new music.

    <p class="aboutP">
    I have a wide knowledge of music theory, in technical and practical contexts, with the latter giving me an intuitive grasp of the musical semiotics used in programmatic/representative music to convey mood, tone, atmosphere, and other "extra-musical" qualities, which is a more efficient and reliable way of composing incidental music than the standard "trial and error" method of the novice composer, and offers greater freedom of expression than the restricted methodology of the modern composer.</p>
    <p class="aboutP">
    I also have a strong foundation in electronic composition and audio engineering, my primary tool being the visual programming language <a href="https://cycling74.com/products/max/">Max/MSP/Jitter</a>, which I've used to construct most of the electronic music featured here. For the interactive content on this site however, I've used the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API">Web Audio API</a> in conjunction with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API">WebGL</a>, as they are easily deployed to the Internet. I also use a variety of other tools in the composition and production of a piece, including DAWs like Ableton Live, music notation software, spreadsheet software and specialized sound processing programs like <a href="http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/">Praat</a>.

    My Style</h2>
    <p class="aboutP">
    I love to write and play any kind of music, but my personal projects use a "fully digital" sound palette, where each sonic element in a piece is generated electronically, then abstracted into sonic parameters (like pitch and volume) that can be controlled by human interface devices(keyboards, motion sensors, microphones etc..), which I then use to record different tracks in the piece.</p>
    <p class="aboutP">
    There are numerous advantages to this method of composing, including a greater variety of possible sounds, more precision when creating sounds, and the ability for large-scale musical constructions (like formal structure, instrumentation and harmonic progressions) to mimic the blueprints used in the small-scale construction of individual sounds.</p>
